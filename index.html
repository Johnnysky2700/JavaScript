    <div id="content">In cryptography, a collision attack refers to an attempt to find two distinct inputs 
(messages) that hash to the same output (hash value) in a cryptographic hash function. 
This is problematic because the purpose of a hash function is to uniquely represent data, 
and a collision undermines that uniqueness.
A collision attack is a cryptographic attack that finds two different inputs that produce the 
same hash value. This attack can undermine the security of a hash function and allow 
attackers to bypass security measures. 
A collision attack in cryptography refers to a method where an attacker finds two different 
inputs that produce the same hash output. This is a significant concern because hash 
functions are often used for data integrity, digital signatures, and password storage. 
HOW COLLISIONS WORK
Attackers deliberately generate inputs that produce the same hash value through the 
hash function. By finding a collision, attackers can create fake digital signatures, 
manipulate data, or undermine the security of digital certificates. Collisions can 
compromise the integrity of databases, allowing attackers to modify or replace vital 
information without detection.
